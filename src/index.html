              Convenience for AI: The regular meter provides a framework for AI
              while allowing flexibility in expression.<br /><br />

              A form of poetry where the visual arrangement of text is as
              important as the words themselves, often creating a shape or
              image.<br />
              Convenience for AI: The visual aspect challenges AI to blend form
              with meaning.<br /><br />
